# Development stages

Update this file whenever a feature is completed. A stage is complete only when its tests and documentation are complete.

## Stage 0 - design and safety scaffold

Status: complete (2026-08-20).

- Confirmed attoDRY legacy COM/DLL interface.
- Confirmed X/Z naming and factory Y/X discrepancy.
- Confirmed 3 T maximum resultant experiment field.
- Confirmed dual SR830 wiring and roles.
- Confirmed no rotator.
- Confirmed caught-exception zero-field policy.
- Added tested vector model, safety validation, and rolling stability predicate.
- Added Codex, hardware, offline-install, and handoff guides.

## Stage 1 - strict configuration and full simulation

Status: complete (2026-08-20).

- Strict TOML loader with unknown/missing-field rejection. Complete (2026-08-20).
- Added simulation cryostat, `lockin_xx`, `lockin_xy`, top gate, and bottom gate.
- Added platform-independent condition, attempt, raw reading, and accepted-result models.
- Added voltage, frequency, X/Z field, temperature-field, gate-grid, and paired-gate scan-point generation.
- Added deterministic timeout, unlock, overload, gate-leakage, communication-failure,
  Ctrl+C, and cleanup-order tests.

## Stage 2 - storage, resume, monitoring, and audit

Status: complete (2026-08-20).

- Added SQLite runs, events, conditions, attempts, raw instrument samples,
  cryostat/gate station samples, transport readings, and checkpoints.
- Enforced the `condition_id`, `attempt_index`, and `accepted` integrity contract,
  including one accepted attempt per condition and one safe station snapshot plus
  six safe xx/xy × h1/h2/h3 readings before acceptance.
- Added explicit `scan_id` storage and a non-inferential schema migration: legacy
  rows are isolated by condition for plotting rather than silently merged.
- Added WAL-safe URI read-only monitoring and the `attodry-monitor` CLI.
- Added resume/retry handling that converts incomplete attempts to audited
  rejections without deleting raw samples or contaminating accepted analysis.
- Persisted every cleanup action, zero/hold confirmation, and the last confirmed
  cryostat state in audit events; interrupted attempts retain station samples and
  any already captured raw lock-in readings.

## Stage 3 - dual SR830 real driver

Status: offline implementation complete (2026-08-20); laboratory validation pending
user-supplied VISA addresses and device safety parameters.

- Added query-only diagnostics and an explicitly authorized minimum-output
  reference-role configuration tool, verified against fake VISA resources.
- Added the standalone device-test procedure and acceptance criteria; real
  instrument validation is still required.
- Added two SR830 adapters distinguished by xx/xy roles.
- Added #1 internal excitation and #2 TTL external-reference configuration.
- Added ordered paired 1/2/3 harmonic measurement: both instruments are set to
  each harmonic before their per-instrument coherent SNAP queries; pair reads
  remain explicitly sequential.
- Added lock, overload, instrument-error, and communication fail-closed behavior
  with partial raw readings retained.
- Added read-only identity/reference/input diagnostics before writes.
- Diagnostics explicitly distinguish query success from complete safety status,
  and duplicate physical SR830 identity aborts configuration before any write.
- The standalone diagnostics and minimum-output configuration read semantic
  addresses, VISA timeout, and frequency from the ignored station-local TOML;
  explicit command-line values remain temporary overrides.

## Stage 4 - attoDRY real driver

Status: offline implementation complete (2026-08-20); real DLL ABI and laboratory
validation pending staged commissioning.

- Added safe 64-bit vendor DLL loading and explicit function signatures.
- Added separately authorized COM connection and initialization timeout.
- Added temperature, VTI, X/Z field, setpoint, control, and error readback with
  last-confirmed-state preservation.
- Added read-before-toggle idempotent temperature/field-control operations.
- Added project-limit validation, safe zero-detour coordinated vector setpoints,
  rolling stable waits, and monitored verified zeroing.
- Added fake-DLL return-code, timeout, write-authorization, path, stability, and
  vector-path contract tests before laboratory use.

## Stage 5 - gate SMUs and integrated acquisition

Status: model-independent offline core complete (2026-08-20); real SMU adapters
require the user's exact models, limits, and command sets.

- Added an explicitly write-authorized, model-independent gate controller with
  configured absolute-voltage limit, current compliance, stepped ramps, voltage
  readback verification, leakage trip, and best-effort zero/disable on failure.
- Added signed Vxx/I resistance using only an explicitly supplied RMS current and
  a separate current helper requiring the complete known series-path resistance.
- Added serpentine two-dimensional Vg1/Vg2 grids and an explicit user/calibration
  supplied linear gate relation for zero-electric-field-line workflows.
- Added hardware-free end-to-end retry, resume, monitor, checkpoint, normal-end
  hold/zero, Ctrl+C, and exception cleanup orchestration against SQLite.
- Added a hardware-readiness gate that rejects unresolved VISA/DLL/SMU addresses
  and all six per-gate safety values before any hardware driver can be built.

## Stage 6 - analysis and notebook migration

Status: offline implementation and rendering QA complete (2026-08-20).

- Added a URI/query-only SQLite loader that defaults to accepted attempts only;
  rejected rows require explicit audit mode.
- Added long-form CSV export, accepted-only gate-leakage loading,
  signed-resistance output gated on explicit RMS current, transport traces, and
  rectangular two-gate maps.
- Added Bx, Bz, resultant field, and signed angle-from-+Z metadata and axes.
- Added the `attodry-analyze` batch CLI and a read-only analysis notebook that
  imports no hardware-control modules.
- Added an auditable publication suite for current/harmonic/frequency/
  temperature/field/angle/gamma, T-|B|, gate-resistance, gate-leakage, and n-D
  outputs. Every generated or unsupported result is recorded in a JSON manifest.
- Required explicit complete series-path resistance and gate calibration for
  derived products; Hall, Nernst, scattering-rate, geometry, and mechanism claims
  are skipped rather than inferred from insufficient measurements.
- Rendered and visually inspected representative PNG figures with the pinned
  matplotlib analysis dependency.

## Stage 7 - laboratory commissioning and offline release

Status: offline checklist and simulation release checks complete (2026-08-20);
real laboratory commissioning and a frozen hardware wheelhouse remain pending.

- Added `LAB_COMMISSIONING.md` with operator-input gates and staged read-only,
  minimum-output, small-movement, zero-bias, and failure-injection checkpoints.
- Added `attodry-simulate`, including deliberate first-attempt unlock injection,
  raw rejection retention, retry, accepted completion, and monitor verification.
- The full offline suite covers 111 tests, including real matplotlib rendering in
  the analysis-enabled environment; source compilation passes without hardware.
- Built and import-checked the local project wheel without downloading
  dependencies; the final filename and SHA-256 are recorded in
  `PROJECT_HANDOFF.md`.
- Pending: exact SMU adapters, real-instrument checks, frozen hardware wheelhouse,
  and offline-control-computer installation verification.
