# Hardware and safety guide

## Magnet coordinates and limits

The active software coordinate system is X/Z:

- Z is the 9 T axial coil in the factory system sheet.
- X is the 3 T transverse coil called Y in the factory system sheet.
- No mechanical rotator is controlled.

The hardware ratings are retained as metadata, but every experiment command is constrained by the user-confirmed project limit:

```text
Bmag = sqrt(Bx^2 + Bz^2)
Bmag <= 3 T
```

This means a pure-Z command is also limited to 3 T in this project even though the Z coil hardware rating is 9 T. Raising the project limit requires a deliberate user-approved change to configuration, documentation, and tests.

Angle is reported relative to +Z:

```text
theta_deg = atan2(Bx, Bz) * 180 / pi
```

The sign-to-physical-direction convention must be confirmed during staged hardware commissioning and stored in the station snapshot.

## Field control

The legacy attoDRY interface uses a USB virtual COM port and a vendor `attoDRYxyz64bit.dll`. The driver must:

- verify the exact DLL path and architecture;
- check every DLL return code;
- wait for device initialization with a timeout;
- read current field, setpoint, control state, and error state before any write;
- implement idempotent `ensure_field_control(enabled)` by read-then-toggle only when required;
- validate the full target vector before setting either component;
- record both component setpoints and readbacks;
- never infer zero after a failed read.

Changing both components may produce a transient path that differs from the requested direction. Constant-direction or constant-magnitude ramps therefore require coordinated intermediate vector points and readback verification; setting X and Z independently once is not sufficient to promise the path.

## Temperature stability

The reference programs demonstrated useful continuous checks but did not include timeout/error handling. The project definition of stable is:

- control is enabled;
- error code is clear;
- all samples in the configured dwell window are within the setpoint tolerance;
- the maximum minus minimum readback in that window is below the configured stable range;
- the wait has not exceeded its timeout.

All tolerances and dwell periods are configuration values and are stored with the run.

## Dual SR830 wiring

`lockin_xx`:

- internal reference;
- SINE OUT drives the sample excitation path;
- measures Vxx.

`lockin_xy`:

- external reference from `lockin_xx` TTL OUT;
- measures Vxy;
- SINE OUT is physically disconnected;
- software sets its output level to the known minimum but must not treat that as an electrical disconnect.

Before acquisition, diagnostics must verify distinct VISA addresses, both IDNs, reference modes, frequency consistency, harmonic, lock state, overload state, time constant, sensitivity, and source readback.

## Exception handling

The agreed default for a caught exception or `Ctrl+C` is zero field. Cleanup order is electrical outputs first, then magnet zero request, then final state logging and disconnect.

APS100 hardware power-fail, quench, and shutdown-input behavior remains an independent protection layer. It does not guarantee that a Python crash returns the magnet to zero.

## Vendor files

Do not commit vendor DLLs. Configure their installed path in `config/hardware.local.toml`. Preserve vendor manuals and installation packages outside the Python repository.
